# Py-Game__Guess-The-Number.2-Players
Here the concept is almost identical to that of 'Guess The Number' but in addition to a new feature. In this Python console game, one have to choose a minimum and a maximum number; between which the 2 players have to guess the unique and randomly generated number for each one after another without any limited time or attempt. Once the 2 players guess the right number, the game announces the winner to whom who chose the unique random number in less attempt than the other player.
